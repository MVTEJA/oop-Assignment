1. A variable is a memory loacation to store datatypes like integer , float , char , double , list , tuple , strings etc .

2. The four primitive built-in types in python are integers , floats , booleans and strings .

3. To give multi line comments .

4. name[1]  returns 'n' , because the index 1 means that we are accessing second element of the list .

5. name[-2]  implies that second last word from end so it is 'a'  .

6. name[1 : -1]  since -1 is not included we get characters from index 1 to -2   i;e  nand Viha .

7. we can use len(name) to get the length of the string name .

8.  a) To use backslash we can do by \\ .
    b) To use ' then we can use \'  to get . for example 'It\'s OK' , will give It's OK.
    c) to get new line use \n .
    d) to get Tab (more space) we use \t .
    e) to remove the space that we have given use \b . 
    f) to get the characters with hex values of the use \x  ,  for example "\x48\x65\x6c\x6c\x6f"  will give all the hexadecimal values of the give hexvalues i;e Hello .
    g) same way to get the charcters from octal value we use "\integer integer integer" .

9. f strings are used to replace the expression with their values .

10. the title function is used to convert the first character in each word to uppercase and the remaining characters to lowercase in the string and then returns a new string .
    for example : t = "my name is vishnu teja"  
                  r = t.title()
                  print(r)
                  the result is My Name Is Vishnu Teja . 

11.strip function removes any spaces at the begining or at the end of the string . if we give any characters in the function it will remove the characters in the string .
   for example : t = "   Assignment   "  , if we give t.strip() , since we haven't given anything it will consider space so the output will be : Assignment .
                 g = ",,,,rrty...Assignment...tyty"  and give g.strip(",.try") , it will remove all those characters which are given as parameters . so the output will be Assignment .
so here in the example name.strip() returns Ananda Vihar . 


12. find function will give the index of the first character of the wors in the string .
    for example : t = "Hello everyone Good morning " 
                  t.find("Good")  will give the index 15 .
    
    so here name.find("Vihar") will return 7 . 
                  
    and returns -1 if the given string is not found in the string . 

13. The name will be Ananda Viharesort  . 

14 . we can use name.find("Ramana")  if it is there it will return index else it returns -1 .

15. integers , floating point numbers and complex numbers are the three distinct numeric types .
